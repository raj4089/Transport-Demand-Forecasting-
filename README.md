# Transport-Demand-Forecasting-
This project  on a transport demand forecasting project for Mobiticket, an inter-city transportation service in Kenya. The project utilized machine learning to analyze over 100,000 bookings across 14 routes to address operational inefficiencies, particularly during peak hours.





By processing raw booking data and creating features, several machine learning models were tested. The Random Forest (RF) model proved to be the most effective, achieving a 94.3% accuracy in forecasting demand.





Key insights from the analysis include:

Peak travel times are a morning rush at 7 AM and an evening rush at 7 PM.


Demand surges by 40% during the December holidays.


The Kisii and Migori routes are the most dominant, accounting for a combined 44% of total demand.

Shuttles have a significantly higher occupancy rate (92%) compared to buses (68%).

The project concludes with strategic recommendations, such as increasing shuttle deployment during peak hours and reallocating vehicles to high-demand corridors, which could lead to a 15-20% reduction in operational costs.
